# Kuyumcu Update (11.07.2020)

Kuyumcu, a simple way to buy and sell Banano using Nano, is here with an update.

### Auto-refund system
Kuyumcu is now able to do a refund automatically to the sender address, if it is sent more than the maximum amount.
For example, you want to sell 10,000,000 BAN to Kuyumcu but you didn't see the maximum amount is specified less than that amount. In such cases, the amount you have sent will be refunded to your address automatically.
> **Important:** It is crucial to not send funds from an exchange, because Kuyumcu does a refund to the sender address. Since the sender address is not your own address when sending from an exchange, you may not receive your funds in such a case.

### 24 hour volume
Total volume of transactions made in the last 24 hours in Kuyumcu is shown on the main page:

### Faster transactions

### Contact page
If you encounter any problems or want to give feedback, you can contact us.

### Usage of browser cookies
Deposit addresses are now dependent on the current browser session. Previously, there was a storage of address pairs on the server-side. Now, deposit addresses are not stored on the server, instead, they are on the browser cookies.
It is very important to press to the "Submit" button, **right after** sending funds to Kuyumcu.

### Alternative way of showing prices
- Buy and sell prices are shown as follows: "@ 0.00081037 NANO". Now, there is "1 NANO : 1234 BANANO", as an alternative way of showing prices.

There were some other improvements on UI.
