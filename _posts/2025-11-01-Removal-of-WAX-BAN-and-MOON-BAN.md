# Notice of Removal of WAX/BAN and MOON/BAN pairs

Dear banano.trade users,

We regret to inform you that the following trading pairs on our platform have been discontinued:

- **WAX/BAN** (wax.banano.trade)
- **MOON/BAN** (moon.banano.trade)

These pairs are no longer available for swapping.

**Please note:** The MOON/Nano pair remains active and available at [moon.nano.trade](https://moon.nano.trade "Go to moon.nano.trade") for buying Moons with Nano (XNO).

We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore other available trading pairs on [banano.trade](https://banano.trade "Go to banano.trade") and [nano.trade](https://nano.trade "Go to nano.trade").

Thank you for your continued support!
