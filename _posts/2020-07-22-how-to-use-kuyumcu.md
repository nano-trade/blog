Enter your Banano address to buy Banano. If you want to sell Banano, you'll need to enter your Nano address. The address that you give to Kuyumcu must be your own address. That is to say that, it shouldn't be from an exchange. You can have your own Banano address from [BananoVault](https://vault.banano.cc). To have a Nano address, [Nault](https://nault.cc) can be used.
> Don't forget to backup the seed of your wallet. Websites are temporary, seeds are permanent. You can follow Settings -> Manage Wallet -> Backup Wallet on BananoVault or Nault to have your seed.

You can copy and paste your address and then click to the "Continue" button.
### 4. Send

If you're selling Banano, it's vice-versa.
Press to the "Submit" button right after sending.
### 5. Receive
