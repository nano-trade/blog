# What happened to Moons?
Initially, Moons were on the Rinkeby network. Then, it moved to a private Arbitrum network.

Now, Moons are on the mainnet (Arbitrum Nova Chain)! Here's the link for viewing Moon transactions using the block explorer: [https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0/token-transfers](https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0/token-transfers)

# How can I buy Moons from Kuyumcu?

You can long press to copy your address to your clipboard.
3. You'll see a Nano deposit address. Send Nano (XNO) to that address, within the specified minimum-maximum amounts. Please use [Nault.cc](nault.cc) as a web wallet or Natrium as a mobile wallet for the best Nano experience.
4. You'll receive Moons to your address, right after your Nano deposit arrives!

# Why use Kuyumcu [(moon.nano.trade)](https://moon.nano.trade) to buy Moons?
The price doesn't change according to the amount you're selling! You can buy as much as you want, the price doesn't go up with the amount you're buying.

# I don't have Nano, but I have USDC on the Polygon network. How can I buy Moons?
You can swap your USDC to Nano (XNO) using [usdc.nano.trade](https://usdc.nano.trade). Then, you can swap your Nano to Moons.

Please see other trading pairs on [nano.trade](https://nano.trade).

# How about selling Moons?
We don't support selling Moons for now. This may change in the future, stay tuned!
